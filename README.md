# GameMaster
Virtual Game Master for real-life board games.

## Directories

### src

This is where source code goes. Different functionality goes into different subfolders if necessary.

### res
This is where you put resources that need to be used by the app (eg.: a map that we overlay onto a grid).

### aux

This is where references and extra information go (eg.: the Warhammer 40k rulebook).
