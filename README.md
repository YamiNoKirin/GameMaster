## Points
Tasks that have been completed and are worth points

#### User Stories
1. Ability to automate non-player tasks in popular games (eg.: Whist, Mafia).
2. Ability to use text-to-speech, people need to be able to 'sleep' in Mafia.
3. Have a reasonable and informative UI, people do not want to use terminals.
4. Do not affect the game too much, people enjoy human interaction while playing.
5. Real time scoreboard for Whist.
6. Have a way to privately disclose Mafia roles, so the game does not get ruined.
7. The game should be playable by any number of players (within reason).
8. The ability to check up on past events - especially Mafia, but Whist history is also useful.
9. One laptop should be enough for an entire game.
10. Have a common UI for all games, nobody wants to learn to use multiple interfaces when they just want to play a game.
11. Players should be able to pick usernames.
